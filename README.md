# k-means
A simple implementation of k-means / kmeans clustering algorithm for demonstration purposes only.

There is a file called random_clusters_generator.py which generates an image with random number of random clusters. This is used as input data for the kmeans clustering algorithm.


#Instructions:

step 1: execute random_clusters_generator.py --> this generates un_clustered.png

step 2: execute kmeans.py --> this generates clustered.png

#note : for a particular "un_clustered.png" execute "kmeans.py" multiple times with different values for k until the random clusters are best clustered.


#note: sometimes the algorithm does not converge in that case, the program has to be killed manually.
